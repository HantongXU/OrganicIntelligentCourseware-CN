[Complex network measures of brain connectivity: Uses and interpretations](https://sph.umd.edu/sites/default/files/files/Rubinov_Sporns_2009.pdf)

- 摘要

Brain connectivity datasets comprise networks of brain regions connected by anatomical tracts or by
functional associations. Complex network analysis—a new multidisciplinary approach to the study of
complex systems—aims to characterize these brain networks with a small number of neurobiologically
meaningful and easily computable measures. In this article, we discuss construction of brain networks from
connectivity data and describe the most commonly used network measures of structural and functional
connectivity. We describe measures that variously detect functional integration and segregation, quantify
centrality of individual brain regions or pathways, characterize patterns of local anatomical circuitry, and test
resilience of networks to insult. We discuss the issues surrounding comparison of structural and functional
network connectivity, as well as comparison of networks across subjects. Finally, we describe a Matlab
toolbox (http://www.brain-connectivity-toolbox.net) accompanying this article and containing a collection
of complex network measures and large-scale neuroanatomical connectivity datasets.
