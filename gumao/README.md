- Abstract

Social media like Facebook, Twitter, or Google+ have become predominant means of communication. However, their distributed structure and dynamic interaction processes make it difﬁcult to analyze and understand that communication. Thus, we propose agent-based modeling and simulation of user behavior for analyzing communication dynamics in social media. We develop an agent decision-making method that models motivations of media users and their impact on behavior by means of social actor types. Moreover, we apply this model to Twitter communication accompanying a German television program. Our evaluation shows that different actor constellations within a population of agents drastically impact the dynamics of this communication.
