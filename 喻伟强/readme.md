[Identification of influential spreaders based on classified neighbors in real-world complex networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0096300317306884)

**Abstract**
> Identifying the influential spreaders in complex network is a very important topic, which is conducive to deeply understanding the role of nodes in the information diffusion and epidemic spreading among a population. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel classified neighbors algorithm to quantify the nodal spreading capability and further to differentiate the influence of various nodes. Here, we believe that the contribution of different neighbors to their focal node is different, and then classify the neighbors of the focal node according to the removal order of the neighbor in the process of k-shell decomposition. By assigning different weights for each class of neighbors and summing up the neighbors’ contributions, the spreading capacity of the focal node can be accurately characterized. Through extensive simulation experiments over 9 real-world networks, the weight distribution of different types of neighbors has been optimized, and the results strongly indicate that the current algorithm has the higher ranking accuracy and differentiation extent when compared to other algorithms, such as degree centrality, k-shell decomposition method and mixed degree decomposition approach. Current results can help to greatly reduce the cost of sales promotion, considerably suppress the rumor dissemination and effectively control the outbreak of epidemics within many real-world systems.

**摘要**
> 识别复杂网络中有影响的传播者是一个非常重要的课题，有助于深入理解节点在人群中信息传播和传播的作用。为此，在本文中，我们提出了一种新的分类邻居算法来量化节点扩散能力，并进一步区分各节点的影响。在这里，我们认为不同邻居对其焦点节点的贡献是不同的，然后根据k-shell分解过程中邻居的删除顺序对焦点节点的邻居进行分类。通过为每类邻居分配不同的权重并总结邻居的贡献，可以准确地表征焦点节点的扩展能力。通过对9个真实网络的广泛仿真实验，优化了不同类型邻居的权重分布，结果有力地表明，与其他算法相比，当前算法具有更高的排序精度和分化程度，如度中心性，k-shell分解方法和混合度分解方法。目前的结果有助于大大降低促销成本，大大抑制谣言传播，有效控制许多现实世界中的流行病爆发。
