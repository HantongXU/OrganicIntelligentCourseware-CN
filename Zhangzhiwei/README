Abstract： 
Classifying large-scale networks into several categories and distinguishing them according to their fine structures is of great importance with several applications in real life. However, most studies
of complex networks focus on properties of a single network but
seldom on classication, clustering, and comparison between different networks, in which the network is treated as a whole. Due
to the non-Euclidean properties of the data, conventional methods
can hardly be applied on networks directly. In this paper, we propose a novel framework of complex network classier (CNC) by
integrating network embedding and convolutional neural network
to tackle the problem of network classification. By training the
classifier on synthetic complex network data and real international
trade network data, we show CNC can not only classify networks
in a high accuracy and robustness, it can also extract the features
of the networks automatically.
