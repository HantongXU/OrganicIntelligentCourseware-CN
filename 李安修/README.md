The present article reviews some basic concepts, important progress, and significant results in the current studies of various complex networks, with emphasis on the relationship between the topology and the dynamics of such complex networks. Some fundamental properties and typical complex network models are described; and, as an example, epidemic dynamics are analyzed and discussed in some detail. Finally, the important issue of robustness versus fragility of dynamical synchronization in complex networks is introduced and discussed.### 摘要在过去几年中，许多自然和人工复杂网络的小世界和无标度特性的发现激发了人们对研究各种复杂网络的基本组织原则的极大兴趣，这导致了新兴和活跃的研究领域的巨大进步。本文回顾了当前各种复杂网络研究中的一些基本概念，重要进展和重要成果，重点介绍了这种复杂网络的拓扑与动态之间的关系。描述了一些基本属性和典型的复杂网络模型;并且，作为一个例子，对流行病学动态进行了详细的分析和讨论。最后，介绍和讨论了复杂网络中动态同步的鲁棒性与脆弱性的重要问题。
