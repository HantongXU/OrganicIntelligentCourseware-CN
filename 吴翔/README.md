[Finding and evaluating community structure in networks][2004 Physical review](https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0308217.pdf)

- 摘要

'''
We propose and study a set of algorithms for discovering community structure in networks—natural divisions of network nodes into densely connected subgroups. Our algorithms all share two definitive features: first, they involve iterative removal of edges from the network to split it intocommunities, the edges removed being identified using one of a number of possible “betweenness”measures, and second, these measures are, crucially, recalculated after each removal. We also proposea measure for the strength of the community structure found by our algorithms, which gives us anobjective metric for choosing the number of communities into which a network should be divided.We demonstrate that our algorithms are highly effective at discovering community structure in both computer-generated and real-world network data, and show how they can be used to shed light onthe sometimes dauntingly complex structure of networked systems.
